Intent
To be a scary game for users to get thrilled by.

Narrative structure


Mechanics
You can move with the arrow keys and change the camera view with the house. You pick up items and go to an area to progress to the next level.

Aesthetics
We went for a realistic looking aesthetic with a generic looking character model.

Joys
It was fun to see the 3d project come together. Especially since some of us had done 2d exclusively before this, it's an empowering feeling to see the same skills we learned help put together a 3d game.

Struggles
It was difficult to get used building 3d objects. The shorter time frame for this project also put a stress on us since this was our first 3d project. When implementing the camera controls, we had to resolve an annoying issue with out package manager and manually tweak the manifest file in order for the project to not implode.
